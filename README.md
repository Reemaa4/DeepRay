## Overview
The Chest X-Ray Diagnostic System is an AI-powered application designed to analyze chest X-ray images and provide automated diagnostic reports. The system integrates multiple modules, including a user-friendly frontend, a robust backend, advanced AI models for image analysis, and a secure cloud-based database for data storage. This modular architecture ensures scalability, efficiency, and accuracy in medical image analysis.

## System Architecture
The system is composed of three main modules, each contributing to the seamless operation of the diagnostic workflow.

### Flask-Based Frontend and Backend Module
The system is built using **Flask**, which integrates both frontend and backend functionalities. The frontend provides an intuitive interface that allows users to upload chest X-ray images and view diagnostic reports. Technologies such as **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript** are utilized to enhance interactivity and ensure a smooth user experience.

The backend is responsible for handling API requests, processing uploaded images, and communicating with AI models and the database. The system also implements validation mechanisms to ensure that uploaded images meet format, size, and integrity requirements before processing.

### AI Model Module
This module consists of two AI models developed for X-ray image analysis. Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, the models leverage **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification. The models categorize X-ray images into four classes: **Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, COVID-19, and Normal**. Additionally, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is employed to generate structured diagnostic reports in plain language, which are then sent to the backend for further processing.

#### Model A: Chest X-ray Classification
The classification model follows a structured workflow. First, essential libraries such as **TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib** are imported. The dataset is then preprocessed by resizing images to (224, 224), normalizing pixel values, and splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

A **DenseNet121** model, pretrained on a large dataset, is fine-tuned for classification by adding a **GlobalAveragePooling2D** layer followed by **Dense layers**. The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer**, and training involves data augmentation to improve generalization. Fine-tuning is performed by unfreezing specific layers of **DenseNet121** and retraining with a reduced learning rate.

To enhance interpretability, **Grad-CAM heatmaps** are generated by computing the gradients of the target class with respect to the last convolutional layer. These heatmaps highlight critical regions in the X-ray image, providing visual insights into the AI modelâ€™s decision-making process.

#### Model B: Report Generator (Encoder-Decoder)
The report generation model follows an **Encoder-Decoder** architecture. The encoder, based on a **CNN**, extracts features from input X-ray images, while the decoder, utilizing **LSTM networks**, generates text-based diagnostic reports.

The input data undergoes preprocessing, including tokenization and vectorization of medical findings. The model is trained using paired image-text datasets, with optimization performed using the **Adam optimizer** and **cross-entropy loss**. Evaluation metrics such as the **BLEU score** are used to assess report accuracy. Once deployed, the model integrates with the backend to generate real-time diagnostic reports.

### Cloud Database Module
The system securely stores X-ray images, diagnostic results, and patient records using **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud MongoDB)**. Data encryption mechanisms ensure patient confidentiality and compliance with data protection regulations. The database is optimized for high performance, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of diagnostic reports and previous medical records. Indexed queries and robust data management practices further enhance system efficiency.

## System Workflow
The diagnostic process begins when a user uploads a chest X-ray image via the **Flask frontend**. The backend validates the image and forwards it to the AI Model module, where deep learning models analyze the image and generate a diagnostic report. The backend then stores the image and diagnostic results in the **cloud MongoDB database**, ensuring seamless access to past diagnoses. Finally, the frontend retrieves and presents the diagnostic report to the user.

## Deployment
The system is designed for accessibility across multiple devices, including **laptops, desktops, and mobile phones**. It is hosted on **cloud platforms** such as **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**, ensuring scalability and high availability. By leveraging modern web technologies, including **Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, and MongoDB Atlas**, the system delivers optimal performance and security.
